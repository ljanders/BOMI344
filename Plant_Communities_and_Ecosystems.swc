      # Uncommenting the following line of code will disable
      # auto-detection of new variables and thus prevent swirl from
      # executing every command twice, which can slow things down.
      
      # AUTO_DETECT_NEWVAR <- FALSE
      
      # However, this means that you should detect user-created
      # variables when appropriate. The answer test, creates_new_var()
      # can be used for for the purpose, but it also re-evaluates the
      # expression which the user entered, so care must be taken.

- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to this demonstration of R using ecological field data!

- Class: text
  Output: R is a powerful and free statistical program that is widely used in the biological sciences.

- Class: text
  Output: We will use R to explore and analyze field data we collected earlier this semester.

- Class: text
  Output: First, let's make sure you understand how and why particular tests apply to our field data.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: We collected soil temperature measurements in three locations at Cantwell Cliffs, on a west-facing slope, a north-facing slope, and in the ravine. Which of the following represents the appropriate null hypothesis for this dataset?
  AnswerChoices: There is no difference in soil temperature among the sites.;Soil temperature will be coolest in the ravine.;Soil temperature will be coolest on the north-facing slope.
  CorrectAnswer: There is no difference in soil temperature among the sites.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='There is no difference in soil temperature among the sites.')
  Hint: Type a hint.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the appropriate statistical test to use to test this null hypothesis?
  AnswerChoices: ANOVA;T-test;correlation;regression
  CorrectAnswer: ANOVA
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='ANOVA')
  Hint: Type a hint.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Suppose we had just two groups to compare. What test would you use then?
  AnswerChoices: T-test;ANOVA;correlation;regression
  CorrectAnswer: T-test
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='T-test')
  Hint: Type a hint.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Regarding an alternative hypothesis, what would you predict, based on your knowledge of Cantwell Cliffs?
  AnswerChoices: West-facing sites will be warmest.;North-facing sites will be warmest.;The ravine will be warmest.
  CorrectAnswer: West-facing sites will be warmest.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='West-facing sites will be warmest.')
  Hint: Type a hint.

- Class: text
  Output: Now that we have decided we need to do an ANOVA, let's figure out how to make R do this.

- Class: text
  Output: Learning R code is like learning any new language. You need to know what the different parts mean and then you can change and 
   rearrange them as you wish.

- Class: text
  Output: The structure of many lines of R code is based on this structure
    Command to R(Dependent variable~Independent variable, data = file with the data)

- Class: text
  Output: For example, the code to calculate our favorite descriptive statistics for soil pH data from Cantwell and Bohannan might look like this
    favstats(SoilpH~Location, data = Soil_pH_data_Bohannan_and_Cantwell)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Based on this, how might you type in a command to calculate your favorite statistics for a dataset called Soil_pH_2018?
  CorrectAnswer: favstats(SoilpH~Location, data = Soil_pH_2018)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='favstats(SoilpH~Location, data = Soil_pH_2018)')
  Hint: The last part of the code is the file name.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In the example, the variable name Location refers to the different places where soil was collected. Suppose you wanted to compare soil pH at different depths instead and had a column called Depth where you had recorded the depth of your soil pH sample. 
    How would you change the command to look at favorite statistics comparing different depths, still using the Soil_pH_2018 file as a source of your data?
  CorrectAnswer: favstats(SoilpH~Depth, data = Soil_pH_2018)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='favstats(SoilpH~Depth, data = Soil_pH_2018)')
  Hint: Depth should be in the position of the independent variable within the command.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Suppose that you wanted to compare the mean pH at two different depths with a t-test.
    The command for a t test is t.test.
    How would you write the code to R to ask for a t-test comparing pH at two soil depths from the Soil_pH_2018 datafile?
  CorrectAnswer: t.test(SoilpH~Depth, data = Soil_pH_2018)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='t.test(SoilpH~Depth, data = Soil_pH_2018)')
  Hint: Command to R(Dependent variable~Independent variable, data = file with the data)
